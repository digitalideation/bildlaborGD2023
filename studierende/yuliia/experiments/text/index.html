  <h1>The Medium is the Message</h1>
  <p>Failure in this respect has for centuries been typical and total for mankind.
Subliminal and docile acceptance of media impact has made them prisons without
walls for their human users. As A. J. Liebling remarked in his book The Press, a
man is not free if he cannot see where he is going, even if he has a gun to help him
get there. For each of the media is also a powerful weapon with which to clobber
other media and other groups. The result is that the present age has been one of
multiple civil wars that are not limited to the world of art and entertainment. In
War and Human Progress, Professor J. U. Nef declared: “The total wars of our
time have been the result of a series of intellectual mistakes . . .”
If the formative power in the media are the media themselves, that raises a host
of large matters that can only be mentioned here, although they deserve volumes.
Namely’ that technological media are staples or natural resources, exactly as are
coal and cotton and oil. Anybody will concede that society whose economy is dependent upon one or two major staples like cotton, or grain, or lumber, or fish, or
cattle is going to have some obvious social patterns of organization as a result.
Stress on a few major staples creates extreme instability in the economy but great
endurance in the population. The pathos and humor of the American South are embedded in such an economy of limited staples. For a society configured by reliance
on a few commodities accepts them as a social bond quite as much as the metropolis does the press. Cotton and oil, like radio and TV, become “fixed charges” on
the entire psychic life of the community. And this pervasive fact creates the unique
cultural flavor of any society. It pays through the nose and all its other senses for
each staple that shapes its life.</p>
  <p> The operation of the money medium in seventeenth century Japan had effects
not unlike the operation of typography in the West. The penetration of the money
economy, wrote G. B. Sansom (in Japan, Cresset Press, London, 1931) “caused a
slow but irresistible revolution, culminating in the breakdown of feudal government and the resumption of intercourse with foreign countries after more than two
hundred years of seclusion.” Money has reorganized the sense life of peoples just
because it is an extension of our sense lives. This change does not depend upon
approval or disapproval of those living in the society </p>
